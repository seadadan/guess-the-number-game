## Guess the number game 🎮🕹

We will be making a simple game!

[Guess number game demo link](https://guess-game-returndev.netlify.app/)

The guessing game will generate a random number from 1 - 100 and the player will guess the random number. The player will have 7 guess to get to the correct random number. The player will also be informed if the number he guessed is higher or lower than the randomz number generated.

The starter folder has the beginning code of the design of the game but not javascript functionality, we will be doing that together!😊
